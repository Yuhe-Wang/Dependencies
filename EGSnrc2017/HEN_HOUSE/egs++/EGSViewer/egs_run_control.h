/*! \brief A simple run control object for advanced EGSnrc C++ applications.

  \ingroup egspp_main

  In EGSnrc applications derived from EGS_AdvancedApplication the program
  execution is controlled by a 'run control object' (RCO). The purpose of
  the RCO is to tell the shower loop into how many 'chunks' the simulation
  should be split, how many particles to run per simulation chunk, into how
  many batches to split a simulation chunk, etc. In this way it is easy
  for EGSnrc C++ application developers to either use one of the RCO's
  provided with egspp or to implement their own RCO's with alternative
  implementations or strategies for {\em e.g.} parallel job processing.

  <p>Terminology
     - Simulations are split into 'chunks'. For simple simulations
       (no parallel runs, etc.) there is a single simulatioin chunk
       with the number of histories specified in the input file.
     - Each simulation chunk is split into 'batches'. The batches are
       not required for statistical analysis (by using the provided
       \link EGS_ScoringArray scoring classes \endlink
       it is easy to has a history-by-history uncertainty
       estimation). Instead, simulation chunks are split into batches
       so that the progress of the simulation can be reported after the
       completion of a batch and the current results can be stored into a
       data file. By default there are 10 batches per simulation chunk

  <p>Two RCO's are provided with egspp:
   - A 'simple' RCO implemented in EGS_RunControl. This RCO is used by default
     for single job control. This RCO provides the ability to run simulations
     with a user specified number of particles and up to a user specified
     statistical uncertainty. It also provides the ability to restrict
     the simulation to a user specified maximum CPU time, to perform restarted
     simulations or to simply analyze the results of a previous run or to
     combine the results of previously performed parallel runs.
   - A \link EGS_JCFControl 'job control file' (JCF) RCO \endlink.
     This RCO is used by default for parallel
     runs. It has all the functionality of the 'simple' RCO plus additional
     methods to contyrol parallel execution via a 'job control file'.

   The JCF RCO is used by default for controlling parallel job execution.
   It is called a JCF-RCO because execution is controlled by a
   file placed in the user code directory, which is created by the first
   parallel job and contains information such as the number of particles
   remaining to be simulated, number of jobs running, combined result of
   all parallel jobs, etc. This RCO objects requires that file locking
   works on the file system containing the \c EGS_HOME directory becuase
   the JCF is locked prior to being modified by one of the jobs to prevent
   multiply jobs modifying the file at the same time. For more details
   see PIRS-877.
