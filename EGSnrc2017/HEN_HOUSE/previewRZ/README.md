## previewRZ

previewRZ uses the Tcl system to preview the RZ geometry from any of the
NRC RZ user codes (DOSRZnrc, CAVRZnrc, FLURZnrc and SPRRZnrc). You must
adjust the first line to point at `wish` on your local system.

Many of the EGsnrc GUIs use Tcl/Tk and `wish`, a freeware package.
The GUIs were developed using Tcl version 7.5, Tk version 4.1 and
wish 4.1 or wishx.  Version 8.0 of Tcl/Tk can be downloaded from
<https://www.tcl.tk/>. When you download Tcl and
Tk you get two programs, `wish` and `tclsh`, supporting script libraries,
and on-line reference documentation.

Note that the makers of Tcl/Tk have made no promises of backwards
compatibility.  We therefore cannot guarantee that these GUIs will
work for all versions of Tcl/Tk, although we strive to do so in
the near future.  Version 8.0 appears to work reasonably well with the
current versions of the GUIs.
